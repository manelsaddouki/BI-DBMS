# Topic:
The idea of this project is to provide restaurants with detailed monthly reports about their performance. The platform, that we use to deliver their products, offers essential data which we can use to give them valuable insights. 

## Tools: 
Talend to transform my data, and Power BI to load and visualize it. 

## Data sources: 
My data sources are divided into three types: 

### 1. Excel:
‘Time’: details related to the delivery time of each order 

### 2. CSV: 
‘Commandes’: Main information about orders 
‘Articles’: Detailed data about each specific article sold 

### 3. JSON:
‘Reclamations’: Claims received from clients 


## Main Steps:
I. Data Cleaning:
As a first step, I checked my data sources. I made sure that my data is consistent, complete, and relevant. 

II. Talend: I prepared 3 main jobs:

N.B: when I downloaded my file sources, I set ‘0’ as the default value (for columns related to prices/revenues). So that I won’t have any null value.  

First job (Revenuesvsdate): a job where I used tMap to: 
Link data about orders (‘Commandes’ file) with details about timing (‘time’ file) 
Filter only the orders that weren’t canceled (code: row1.Annulee_.equals ("Non"))
=> We got an output Excel file with the filtered data 

Second job (part3):
 I used tMap to link data about articles (‘Articles’ file) with details about timing (‘time’ file)
Filter the orders that weren’t canceled 
 => We got an output Excel file ‘Part 3

Grouped the number of orders per category and per order
Sorted the output file in ascending way (Sorted by Category and Article)
 => We got an output Excel file ‘Aggregation out3’


Third job (part4): 
I transformed my JSON file into an output Excel file
I filtered the data to get only the claims that are due to a restaurant’s fault not the startup’s,. 
 => We got an output CSV file ‘Part 4’



=> Talend is my staging area where I extracted my data and then transformed it. 

III. Power BI: 

Data Warehouse part:
             I loaded my data on my Power BI Desktop:
I created three new tables 
I grouped the ‘total number of orders per date’ 
I grouped from the new table the ‘number of work days per weekday’ 
I grouped data (from the 2nd Talend output table) per category => article => weekday => Start Hour 
Then I used Power Query Formula Language (‘M’ language) to import the nb of work days per weekday (used the VLOOKUP function)
Finally, I added new columns to count the average of articles sold (used the DIVIDE function)

Data Modeling: I created the relationships between my facts and dimensions tables.


=> ‘time slot’ is the principal fact table that I created from two dimensions
=> ‘nb of orders per day’ is an aggregation table I made from Out1
=> ‘nb of work days’ is an aggregation table I created from ‘nb of orders per day’

I renamed my tables and columns in a user-friendly way 

I created new columns: e.g Id day (I needed this column to sort weekdays in my matrices from Monday to Sunday and not in alphabetical order)


B. Data Visualization:

I. I created a report that includes 7 pages:

1. Orders vs dates 
We can notice that the highest revenues were on the 18th and the lowest were on the 16th: the manager should investigate the reasons for such a decrease 
No revenues between the 9th and the 10th and that’s possibly because of Aïd Al-Adha

2. Orders per weekday
The highest nb of orders was on Monday: The manager should focus on this weekday to avoid any delay or mistake while preparing the orders 

3. Revenues per category 
The category with the highest revenues was ‘BURGER’ 
The lowest percentage of revenues was for ‘Pizza’ => this category generated only 0.11% of the restaurant’s revenues: it’s important to find the solution (whether to introduce new recipes/ discounts / eliminate it from the menu..)

4. Orders per category
Over 50% of the orders were for ‘Burgers’ => They should make sure that enough ingredients of this category are available to meet the high demand 
Very low demand for ‘Pizza’ (0.05%) => This confirms that a solution should be implemented to attract more people to this category 

5. Articles revenues per Category
For Burger: Cheese Bum generated the highest revenues. 
For Desserts: Chocobout generated over 60% of the revenues
For ‘Our best sellers’: some articles like Cheesy Dog or Smoky Burger porc generated around 0% of the revenues 

6. Articles orders per Category
For Desserts: The lowest demand was for Cheesecake Chocolat (around 1.5%)
For Burger: Cheese Bum had the highest revenues. We can take advantage of these articles to promote others (e.g introduce menus with Cheese Bum and Cheesecake chocolate with a small discount)
For ‘Our best sellers’: some articles like Cheesy Dog or Smoky Burger porc had around 0% demand => the restaurant should consider the option of eliminating such articles from this category (as they are not best-sellers)

7. Time Slot
On Monday: the restaurant received the highest number of orders between 12-2 pm and 7-10 pm. Starting from 8 pm it was over 30 orders per hour => The manager should keep the option of increasing the nb of his staff members during these periods 
During the weekend (Th-Su) the pick was between 7 pm-10 pm 

8. Claims 
The number of claims was 18 with 9 claims because of ‘Missed Articles’: employees must check the order before they deliver it
This restaurant had the highest number of claims compared to the others => The manager should set a strategy to avoid such a number in the future ( Possible solution: add a staff member who should verify the nb and the quality of the articles before it gets delivered) 

II. I published the report and created a dashboard on the Power BI service + I pin three cards that highlight total revenues + total nb of orders during the month + nb of categories the business has.

‼️ The report & the dashboard are both submitted with this document  ‼️
